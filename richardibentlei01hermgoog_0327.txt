‘dationes in duas priores Aristophanis ·-Fabulas.‚
In praefatione autem disseritur de aspiratione ο
Vau prout· in sermone Homerico obtinebat.
Agmen extremum claudunt 'alterae Animadver-
siones in Phileleutheri Lipsiensis sive Bentleii
''Emendationes in Menandri et Philemonis 'Reli-
’ quiaS. I have a pretty large apparatuS‚ out of
which these emendations will* be selected3 upon
Aristophanes in particular about 1500. For
„one of these I am in a great measure obliged
to a conjecture· of yours ‚ Lect. Lys. p. 686.
For the nonsensical αναπολεισθαι ‚you write
ἆπολισθαινει. But we have by this means a
Dactyl 'in the beginning of a Trochaic verse,
contrary to the laws of that. By the way, the
true ¹writing of the verb you bave offered is55o
απολισθανει. 1 read av· απολισθοι. This read-
ing you will find preferable to your conjectu-
re, even in point of dictione I need not men·-
tion its conformit‘y to the laws of the Trocbaic
verse, or the proximity of its form to 'that of
the common lection.

Your company at Newcastle will give very
great pleasure to , Sir,

- Your obliged humble Servant
