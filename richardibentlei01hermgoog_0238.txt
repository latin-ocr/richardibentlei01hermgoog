I retum you my hearty thanks fo'r your kind
' present of the Sigean ‘Inscriptiom illustrated
with the learned and elaborate commentary of
theflev. Mr. chishun. 1- read it ιιω night
before 1 went to bed; and upon the perusal Ι
was confirmed in the opinion, that I told you
- 1 had, on the first view of it. 1 make bold
to give you my reason83 'which (if you think
{141 fit) you may communicate to the learned edi-
tor, with my thenlks and service.-
Mr. Chishull tells us (μδ.) that the less in- ¹
scription is wrote on the upper part Qf the
3, stone, not on the side as in the edition.⁸ I
shall* give it therefore in common alphabet thus:
