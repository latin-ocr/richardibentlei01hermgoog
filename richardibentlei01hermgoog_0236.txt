210
copies, in th'e time of the Council of Nice,
without the error of 50 words.

Now in this work I indulge nothing to

any conjecture, not even in 3 letter, hut proceed

solely upon authority of copies, and Fathers ’
of that age. And wh'at will he the event ahout
‘the said verse o'f 101m31 myself know not yet5

having not used 311 the old copies thn't I hm

mformation of.

But by this you see, that tn my propuued

' work, the fate of that verse will be a mere

queetion of fact. You endeavour to Provej
(and that's 311 you &spire to ,) that it may have

been ‘writ ’ hy the Apostle‚ being consonant to “ “

his other doctrine. This 1 concede to you,
ρ and if the fourth century knew that text, let ιι

· come in, in God’s name: but if that age did not

know it, then Arianism ιιι its height -was beat
devm, without the help of that verse· und ’

let the fac-'t prove a's it wi11‚the dccv-ine is
unthaken'

Yours, “
