The reader is now presented with part of Dr. Bent- 403 ’
ley's Correspondence which is here printed sor the first
time.- The Letter to Ioshua Barnes respecting the au-⁴
theuticity of the Epistles attributed to Euripides, was
written at the beginning of the year 1693, in reply
to some enquiries which Bentley had received from
him upon. this subject. Barnes was at that time =en-‚
gaged in preparing his edition of Euripides for the
presa, and having heard from some friend that Bentley
considered these productions supposititious, wrote to
enqnire his reasons sor this opinion. This letter is
the same which Bentley speaks of in liis ‘Dissertation
on Euripides’ssEpistles', p. 121· (ed. Bowyer‚ p. 419.)
it is copied from the original, lately presented. to the
Bri-tish Museum by the possessor, ΜΓ. Holme.

The others are a specimen of a very large and
valuable collection of Letters to Bentley, with copies
of some of his Anmem, which having been successi-
vely the property of Dr.n Richard Bentley of Nail-

stone, his Nephew and Executor, and of the late
Additum. a ²
