Er. Richard Cumberl'and hia Grandson ‚ were presented
by the latter, manyryears ago, to Trinity College. lt
⁵ contains the lettera of spanheim , Graevius, liu-ter,
Hemsterhuin , Reland, watstein , Peter Burmann, F ran-
ci· Burmann, Perizonius, Dorville, and many otherx
distinguished literar-y characters , · with whom ‘Bentley ’
404 was in the habits of intimate correspondence at diffe-
rent perioda of his life. These original documents,
which were supposed to have been lost, were disco-
vered in the Lodge of Trinity College , upon the death
of the late Master. Of this whole collection not more
than three or four have ever been before the world.
Of the Epistulae &itio-ae addreased to Kaster, it'
is necessary to remark, that they are the original ve·-
hicles by which Bentley conveyed his observatione
upon the two first Plays oi Aristophanes. Kuster, who
was then publishing his edition with extreme haste,
distected. Bentley’s letters, and put them into the form
of noteS, in a manner very different from the inten- ,
tion of the writer3 carefully omitting all particulars in
² which his own observatione, which ,were already prin-
ted, had anticipated those of his illustrious correspon-
dent, It is therefore due to the same of Bentley, to
give these documenta in their genuine form. He wrote
three lettera upon the subject of Aristophanes: bnt only
the two last are found in this collection: of the first
he probably did not preserve a copy.
