Ἐν τῷ λίθῳ εἰμὶ ἀνδριὰς aba) τὸ σφέλας.
In lapide sum statua et basis,

This ‚is justly censured by Mn* Chishull , as ,

both varying from the original and void of all

'good sense.
Mr. Chishuu goes exactly to the letters, and

reads thus:
οὐ αὐτοῦ λίθου alp) ἀνδριὰς καὶ τὸ σφέλας.
Non sum ejusdem lapidis et statua et basis.

. But with 2111⁸submission‚ even this sense seems
too low, and not-worthy μ) be said to all· spe-
ctatbrS. For what wonder that the stat'ue and

· basis should be of different stones3 when in the .
greater statues ’twas scarce ever otherwise, the .

Ι statue being fix’d and solder’d to the base. Ῑ

’ll try my hand at it, and shall keep exactly

to the letters ς’ only beg leave to' suppose a

Toev, which in above 2'000' years may have
been wom out at the beginning.

253. 1 read, Τοῦ αὐτοῦ λίθου ff ἀνδριὰς ,καὶ

, τὸ σφέλας.
Ex eodem lapide sumamma et basis}
, That is, to the then pronunciation‚ and in

the now orthography,
Ίῖαὖταῦ λίθου· 2de timonag- καὶ τὸ

σφέλας. .
