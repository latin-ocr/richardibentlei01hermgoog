„hau teu them as short as 1 can ’ My heatus,
, Ι thank God, has been pretty good, all this

winter. About a mouth ago Ι wrote a book

against Mr. Β. I suppose you may have' heard
of or seen it: if Ι knew how to send you one,

2571 have one at your service. But Ι design to

¹ send you a parcel of books for your use3 and
so Ι may send this wnh -.them In your letter
you desired to know the names of the hooke,
that you might see if they were for your turn.
But there's no need of· that, because Ι design
to present you with what> Ι send you, and not
make you pay for them. The Bishop of Wor-
cester (my old patron), who is ‘now at Low
.don‚ lies very sick5 and I1fear he, will hardly·
recover: Ι am now in my waiting “mouth aa,
chqplain to the'King3 hut after Easter 1 shau
’ be at liberty, and then Ι may think of my‘
riding journey. My kind love *and servicem
my ‚sister Bentley. · My cosin sarah presents
hers too· , ’ , ⁵
⁸ ³ Your affectionate* Brother,

B. B.
